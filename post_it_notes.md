# Post-It Notes
Date:11/03/21

## What I need to attach in Faser
- Handout can be done individually/groups/large groups -> need to think about what I want to do
- Handouts = learn by doing
- Comment on this and link back to the background research

## 04/03/22 Capstone meeting
- Making origami the question
- Holding this slide before intro -> Origami + Maths
- STEAM: architecture
- design engineering
- Why engagement talks are helpful at start
- Conclusion of why I did origami

- general lesson plan
- make and finish content of slides for 11 th march
- annotation

- creative commons
- attribute footnote
- public domain
- Andrew Dunn, 1988 etc
### lesson plan
- how long to take
- how long expected
- e.g. how would you present it before explanation
- question extensions after or closer to deadline

## 11/03/22
- What is origami? as the starter question for on the board
- hint: etc..
- no need for overview
- add pictures
- who knows where origami is from?
- originally chinese
- what is euclid -> geometry; axioms ->rule of a game, so everything can be derived from the rules
- decolonising euclid -> most well known, well preserved in terms theory
- to the above point, there were other people who did geometry before

- Euclid blank paper -> static
- rule and compass
- you can get these rules for geometry
- e.g. circular theorem, congruents, etc
- example is triangle angles inside add up to 180 using euclid axioms

- huzita-hatori axioms
- moving, use paper folding

- from euclid, sixth form -> abstract

- computational
- place it earlier in the presentations
- in history / intro
- animation of satellite origami

### 1st activity
- folding
1. bisecting euclid fold, first handout
2. trisecting angle using H-H axioms

- pythagoras theorem
- demonstration of a^2+b^2 = c^2
- quick question
- worksheet

- e.g. label pythagoras theorem on a triangle

- assume we provide origami paper
- proof by origami
- bit by bit
- what did you get out of it for the students

- relate each section/step to pythagoras theorem so they know why it is a right angled triangle

### video recording
- think of what to record
- what questions you might get
### things to think about
- make handouts
- think of extensions
- can relate folding to the axioms

### what do i need on faser
1. presentation + handouts
2. lesson plan (1 side)
 - what needed
 - set up
 - how long for section of slides
 - be careful of what might happen during slide x, slide y, etc
 - beware these questions might come
 - what the students should get from this
3. detailed table with each slide from presentation
 - axiom meaning -> explain
 - pythagoras theorem -> what is it
 - note: if someone was to do the lesson, what do they need so in the details of the note it should say here
 - e.g. print page of handout
 - e.g. decolonising -> not focusing on western world, e.g. from oriental
 - have in write up too
4. 5 minute video
 - self reflection video
 - good and the bad
