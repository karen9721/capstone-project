Blog post notes 

 

From [1], it can be seen that it is important to use headings so that the audience can see step-by-step what the procedure is when explaining concepts. There are bold headings and subheadings so that it is easier for the reader to find the relevant information. It has a conversational language tone to engage with the reader. 

As seen in [2], there is also an introduction to the topics covered in the blog. It includes the code snippets in a code box to make it easier for the readers to test out the code themselves by being able to copy the code easily. It is more interactive for some of the images which shows how it is done. For example, there is an animated image to show where the cursor moves, the graph changes. Each blog summaries and provides further reading for the reader to explore if they were interested.  

On the website [3], which is the main page for most of the references used, it has shown the range of ways to start the blog. Some have included the heading “Introduction” [4], whereas others [5] and [6] removes the heading and still includes the introduction. Another way of starting a blog was seen in [7], where they started it really short with “Recently, I watched this Ted Talk”, and proceeds to embed the video in the blog. This creates a different perspective to other blogs as it encourages the reader to potentially watch the video, or if not, they’ve explained it below the video itself. 

Important things to note/remember are written in bold as shown in [8] and ends with a recap of what the reader has learnt from the following blog. In [9], it also shows certain words in bold which capture the importance of the concepts learnt.  

 

Plans for my blog post 

    Either include Introduction heading or not and just go straight in
