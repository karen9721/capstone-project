# Word dump of the research (clean/organise after)

From the research I had been doing, there has been a series of similarities as well as differences. Firstly, I had done some of my research prior to taking an interest to the project as I previously was interested in learning new things such as different maths things. So I used to watch a lot of YouTube videos in the background or sometimes more focused in whatever I was intrigued by. Then when the project briefs came along, I was interested in origami maths and went to research more about that to see whether I would be interested. The topic origami maths was actually another project idea by Abdul Salhi who was doing a project on error modelling in origami maths. I found that interesting and wanted to learn more about what origami maths was. I didn't do the project in the end, but wanted to show the creative side of maths through the project Communicating Mathematics/Data Science. Hence, I am now doing one on that specific thing. However, there is another one that I was interested in, that came way before my third year. This was when I was applying for university and was captivated by music and maths, and John Cage who created compositions based off of one number, or a set of numbers and then his piece would showcase that specific number. This was really interesting to know more about Music of the Spheres which also showed that arts and sciences were actually really closely related and similar before they diverged into their respective places in this modern society that those who are from either of the fields may have discrepencies that they are in no way similar or plausible to have been working one without the other. Aka, you need to have creativity to be able to make the findings of science and logic. In this modern society, many think that they are so different that it would be like blasphemy or crazy to say they are linked. There was another word starting with a "c" but I can't quite remember what it was to replace "crazy". 

So, onto the research. Oh before that, I also had went to quite a few talks, masterclasses, webinars, seminars, summer schools and workshops which contributed to my research findings. Albeit in honesty, it comprises of many years of opinions, I believe that not much has changed for some of it in the teaching methods and styles. So, without further ado, lets get to writing it all down. 

So, in terms of the first ones I've mentioned above, majority of the things above are mostly classified as engagement activities albeit some may be more informative, it was not necessarily as much a teaching event as university lectures or inaugural lectures. Hence, I would classify most of them as a majority to be an engagement kind. So, let's talk different ages which can then help to showcase the styles and methods and all the nitty gritty bits. 

1. talks and masterclasses
Okay, so this may have to have quite a few sections since depending on the year I went to the talks, they changed in terms of the reading level and spoken level of understanding. Firstly, the ones from when I was in secondary school, so I would be between the years of Year 9/10/11, or it might be in the first year of sixth form at age 16/17, where I remember going to some masterclasses at Greenwich University for mathematics masterclasses. This was interesting because we would have had some knowledge of A-level maths and was learning more about that. This would be an engagement activity and had been explained with a depth that A-level students would understand but with still a bit of difficulty in the concepts that are for university students to study. Whilst it was difficult to understand everything, it was fistly explained in a more basic manner and continued to be a fun topic so that students would be engaged and interactive during the masterclass. It involved doing activities in between explanations and was for the day with breaks and tours.

Other talks included ones from summer schools, in which this was for a whole week, albeit not all were mathematics, during the time at Royal Holloway for applying as a university, there was an induction day for mathematics and music. At this time, this included an introduction to mathematics and what is included as well as a lecture. Whilst it was already pre-assigned to have specific events during the day, it was an engagement activity but no longer aimed for lower aged students, therefore, it was a lot more serious similar to a lecture. It was informative, yet not boring as it was of interesting topics.

Generally most talks have in common is the use of hand gestures and making eye contact with the audience. By doing so, it keeps the audience engaged and focused on what the speaker is saying. Some speakers like to include humour to lighten the session and ensure that it is not too heavy on the delivery of content. Others, due to time constraints and the amount of content needed to be covered would tend to stay focused and leave questions until the end and would sometimes speak faster without realising, especially for those who have already made presentations or have hand-written the notes instead of doing them live. Due to this, it can be confusing and overwhelming for the audience as there is a lot of information chucked at them yet they have not had the time to take it in to absorb and understand.  

2. seminars and webinars
These tend to have more content shown and delivered but depending on what the topic is, it can be quite fun and engaging. For example, there were a few seminars delivered in the DMS (Department of Mathematical Sciences). These were delivered to a range of age groups from university undergraduate students, postgraduate students and the staff members, depending on who are interested in joining. Most of the time, there is a lot of content and explanation, in which with the time frame of about under an hour, it is hard to be able to explain in depth what is happening. However, by using more technical terms, it can be understood by some lecturers and staff, but not all if it is not their main focus/specialty. Due to this, for students, it is more of trying to learn new things whilst coming out not fully understanding all the mathmatical content, however it increases the feedback loop of potentially being interested in the topic itself and researching more independently. With these seminars, some of them are interesting topics which lead to a better turnout versus some which are worded in a way that not many students may understand, hence a lower turnout. Due to this, it would be best when delivering a topic to know who the target audience is so that the title of the topic is understood by that age group/audience.

Webinars are not always as easy to do as some may talk faster and go through slides faster without knowing if the audience understood what they were talking about. Due to this, it is more difficult to deliver sessions online as many people may not turn their cameras on, which would lose the factor of face-to-face teaching, or delivery. Without their cameras, speakers can find it difficult to know if the audience are finding them (the speaker) talking too fast, or too slow, whether things need to be repeated. In addition, related to lectures, it can become difficult to speak up to ask questions.

As for academic journals, it is important to be adaptive in teaching STEM subjects and that we learn to be more flexible as it can be difficult to keep STEM subjects engaging. There are also a lot
