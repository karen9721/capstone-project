This will be what I will use to write up my notes when I am doing research so to minimise the amount of editing and updating.

Thursday 25th November 2021 - talk by Joe Bailey - "Modelling and Analysis of Individual Animal Movement", ED-3S (Essex Data Science Seminar Series)
- Type of talk: Online Seminar
- Bullet points and using a laser to explain similar to how we would point to what we were explaining
- First make a summary of what we cover
- Then onto bullet points that are more easier words
- Next, go into further detail by showing the maths
- Must make sure it flows so that it can make sense
- Potentially using a whiteboard
- Using animations or a line box to accentuate what we are focusing on
