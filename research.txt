This will be what I will use to write up my notes when I am doing research so to minimise the amount of editing and updating.

Thursday 25th November 2021 - talk by Joe Bailey - "Modelling and Analysis of Individual Animal Movement", ED-3S (Essex Data Science Seminar Series)
- Type of talk: Online Seminar
- Bullet points and using a laser to explain similar to how we would point to what we were explaining
- First make a summary of what we cover
- Then onto bullet points that are more easier words
- Next, go into further detail by showing the maths
- Must make sure it flows so that it can make sense
- Potentially using a whiteboard
- Using animations or a line box to accentuate what we are focusing on

Research on the different styles of teaching.



Based on the research, there has been a variety of teaching styles and methods for both mathematic topics and non-mathematic topics. Firstly, to talk about the ones aimed towards the general public, the language used is mostly general and lower level rather than using complex words from the maths jargon. In this, they tend to stand in the circle for TedX talks, or move around a bit, but not a lot. For this, they are more engaging using their hands and arm movements to ensure that the audience are still engaged and understanding the topic.

In Inaugural Lectures, these are more complex for the adults and mathematicians. Hence, it can be more difficult to understand all of the words.



Target Audience

TedX/Ted talks are aimed to a range of people, which means a range of ages. Inaugural lectures tend to aim towards lecturers/students who understand more maths. Christmas talks from the Gresham College has a range of talks which are for different ages.





Teaching Styles

Presentation, live lecture, online video, etc.



Way of presentation

Hand gestures, mostly standing in one spot for presentations on TedX Talks. Hand gestures is all across the board.



Use of language and jargon

Links to level of understanding for the target audience, reading level too. For example, the talks for TedX are lower language and not as complex or uses as much jargon, whereas Inaugural lectures tends to be more complex and a higher level of language.
